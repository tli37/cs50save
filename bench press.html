        <p>
            The Bench Press is one of the most popular gym exercises for developing chest muscles and one of the events in a powerlifting competion. In competition the bar must pause at the chest before given the signal of the judge before it is allowed to be pressed up again.
            The butt must also be in contact with the bench. In some federations the whole feet must also be in contact with the ground.
            <br><br>
            The Bench Press utilizes mostly the muscles of the chest, triceps and front deltoids for the pressing movement, but also a strong upper back helps with stability.

        <p> Creating a good setup with good tension in the body is one of the most important factors of achiving a heavier bench press.
        Pressing from a loose setup according to Swedish athlete Marcus Grahn is similar to : "Shooting a cannon out of canoe".
        Many people in powerlifting utilize an <p-bold> arched </p-bold> back position to some degree to increase the tension while also lowering the range of motion needed for the lift.
        Other techniques such as retracting the shoulder blades or squeezing the bar are just some cue that might be used to increase the stabiltiy of the lift.
