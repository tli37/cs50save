        <p> Powerlifting is a strength sport where the athlete competes in three lifts: Squat, Bench Press and the Deadlift.
        Three attempts is made in each lift and the highest weight completed in each is summed up into your Total.</p>


        <p> Here is an example of a series where missed lifts are denoted by a strikethrough</p>

        <h3>Federations, Categories and Drug Testing</h3>
        <p> There are several federations with different rules, regulations and world records. Firstly there are drug tested and non-tested federations. In a non-tested organisation many athletes choose to use performance enhancing drugs.
            There are also differences in <p-bold>Equipped</p-bold> or <p-bold>RAW/classical</p-bold> powerlifting. The equipment in Equipped powerlifting helps moving the weight noticably in the lift itself while the equipment in RAW powerlifting is mostly there to protect and support the body.
            In the biggest organisation IPF the RAW division was created as late as 2012 and has risen in popularity due to more relatability to the average gym goer and increased ammount of people attending the gym in general.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore athletes are divided into classes gender, age and weight-wise. The open age class is 23-39 but athletes of any age can enter.
            Body weight or more specfically muscle mass has a strong correlation to total strength, and while a female elite lifter tend to be much stronger than the average male, classes are needed to ensure good competition and similar conditions for athletes.
