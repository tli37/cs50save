        <p>
            The Deadlift is a lift that utilizes almost the whole body and involves lifting the bar from the ground and standing up.
            <br>
            In a powerlifting competition one must lock out the lift properly, which in the deadlift means that the lifter must stand erect with knees and hip locked out, and with shoulders back.
            If one exercise or lift could describe one individual's total strength, many athletes consider the Deadlift as the best lift to measure that. The deadlift is often present in other strength sports like Strongman or Crossfit for this particular reason.



        <h3>Technique</h3>
        <p> There are two big styles in the deadlift, which is the <p-bold> normal/conventional deadlift </p-bold> or the  <p-bold> sumo deadlift </p-bold></p>

        <figaction class="centerpic"> Sumo Deadlift </figaction>

        <p>The main difference between the two styles is where the athlete's leges are in relation to its hands. In the conventional deadlift the hands are outside the legs, while in the Sumo deadlift the hands are situated inside the legs.
        What's suited for each indivudual is going to depend on hip mobility, and strength differences in the lower body. Generally a Sumo deadlift is slightly more demanding on the Quadriceps and less demanding on the lower back. </p>
